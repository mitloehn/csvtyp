# Reference Tables and How to Find Them

rayner.py

- go through CSV corpus and check via subset, O(n^2)

- use ray package for parallel processing

full run about 4 hours:

  make para

results:

- tabs.tex for upload to shlat

- changes in csv.db for further sql


csv.db:
not part of git repo as it is 2.2 GB and everything is created in rayner


nerctools: 

cython version of subset check.  nice try, epic fail. slower than pure python.
